### Project Highlights

Welcome to my portfolio of groundbreaking projects where I harness advanced machine learning and artificial intelligence technologies to tackle complex real-world problems. Here’s a glimpse into some of the innovative work I’ve been involved in:

#### ML in Healthcare: C-SCLC Prognosis and Survival Prediction

In a significant stride towards enhancing cancer care, I developed a machine learning model to predict prognosis and survival rates for patients with Combined-Small Cell Lung Cancer. Utilizing powerful frameworks like PyTorch and TensorFlow alongside libraries such as NumPy, this model achieved an impressive recall of 81% for identifying high-risk patients. This model's outcomes are profound, contributing to personalized medicine approaches and currently under review for publication in a prestigious journal.

#### CGU AI Bot: Revolutionizing Campus Communication

I spearheaded the development of an internal AI-driven chatbot for Claremont Graduate University, designed to streamline information access for both staff and new students. This project employed fine-tuned language models with Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG) and was built using the cutting-edge LangChain and GPT APIs. For easy deployment and user interaction, we utilized Streamlit to create a robust, intuitive interface.

#### Student Loan Risk Assessor

Tackling the complexities of financial data, the Student Loan Risk Assessor leverages advanced data mining techniques to predict default risks. This project is a cornerstone in understanding and mitigating loan defaults, providing valuable insights that aid financial institutions in making informed decisions.
