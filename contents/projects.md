### Project Highlights

Welcome to my portfolio of projects where I harness advanced machine learning and artificial intelligence technologies to tackle complex real-world problems. Here’s a glimpse into some of the innovative work I’ve been involved in. 

#### ML in Healthcare: C-SCLC Prognosis and Survival Prediction

In a significant stride towards enhancing cancer care, my team and I developed a machine learning model to predict prognosis and survival rates for patients with Combined-Small Cell Lung Cancer. Utilizing powerful frameworks like PyTorch and TensorFlow alongside libraries from Scikit-learn, we built an ensemlble of models to find the perfect fit. The best model achieved an impressive recall of 81% for identifying high-risk patients. This model's outcomes are profound, contributing to personalized medicine approaches and currently under review for publication in a prestigious journal.

#### CGU AI Bot: Revolutionizing Campus Communication

I spearheaded the development of an internal AI-driven chatbot for Claremont Graduate University, designed to streamline information access for both staff and new students. This project employed fine-tuned language models with Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG) and was built using the cutting-edge LangChain and GPT APIs. For easy deployment and user interaction, we utilized Streamlit to create a robust, intuitive interface. The model is currently in a private repo for privacy reasons with the university. But the trial version is shared below using Google Customizable Search Engine, StreamLit, OpenAI, and Langchain.

#### Student Loan Risk Assessor

Tackling the complexities of financial data, the Student Loan Risk Assessor leverages advanced data mining techniques to predict default risks. Givem by our college, taking advantange of their data science team, this project is a cornerstone in understanding and mitigating loan defaults, providing valuable insights that aid the financial department in making informed decisions.

#### Artificial Consciousness Design Artifact

Pushing the boundaries of AI, this project aims at creating a digital persona that can respond with facial expressions based on visual and voice sentiment analysis. This initiative explores the intersection of emotional AI and human-computer interaction, paving the way for more empathetic and intuitive digital interactions. This is in a work in progress and is being developed heavier in theory. Paper to be publised in September.
