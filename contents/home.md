Hi, I'm Parzon! I am currently a PhD Candidate at Claremont Graduate University, specializing in Information Systems and Technology with a focus on Data Science. My research primarily explores Generative AI and Large Language Models for cross-domain applications, as well as Machine Learning for Healthcare Applications. Currently, I am expanding my expertise into computer vision to broaden my application surface and engage in more diverse projects.

I always enjoy extra-curriculars, as I'm currently the Machine Learning Club President at CGU, under the Mathematics and Data Science departments.
